With most companies, this is typically included in the price of your car rental and will be in the form of a deductible hold on your credit card. Make sure to check if your credit card can cover the costs of this deposit before you rent a car. Additional insurance such as a Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or theft cover is recommended, but not mandatory.","Summertime in Ibiza Town Ibiza Spain","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.unsplash.com\u002Fphoto-1565352336881-dc2c1f7d2d5b?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=435&q=80","It's recommended to include any extra coverage at the time of making your initial car rental reservation since the prices tend to be most favorable then.

The roads and motorways are in excellent condition and typically don’t have much traffic, leaving room for you to enjoy the surroundings.","On a road trip through Spain, you’ll often find yourself driving next to beautiful flowers or over high bridges, perched in between the mountains. Outside of major cities like Madrid or Barcelona, it’ll get busier but it remains easy to drive around.","Street music in the cathedral square","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.unsplash.com\u002Fphoto-1529068726703-d4dfa1c99b99?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1169&q=80","When traveling on motorways in Spain, also known as autopistas and autovías, it's imperative to observe the speed limit of 120 km\u002Fh. Autopistas are toll roads marked with the letters \"AP,\" while Autovías (indicated by \"A\") are free highways that run parallel to the Autopistas. It's essential to keep in mind the speed limit as the roads are monitored by the national guard and police. On main roads, the speed limit varies between 80 km\u002Fh to 100 km\u002Fh. In urban areas, the speed limit is either 50 or 70 km\u002Fh. Be sure to pay attention to traffic signs and adhere to the specified speed limits.","Burro taxi","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.unsplash.com\u002Fphoto-1496255904331-1a9d161384c2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=435&q=80","Even though Spain does have a few toll roads, on some Autopistas (AP) and radial roads (R), they’re significantly less common than in the neighboring countries Portugal or France. These roads are typically ones that go through mountain tunnels or involve another form of engineering and, therefore, require more maintenance.","When you opt for one of these roads, you can pay the toll in cash, by credit card, or with the electronic device Via-T. The toll routes in Spain typically cost between 5 and 30 EUR depending on the distance you travel on the route and the location of the Autopista.","Barcelona, Spain,steep street","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.unsplash.com\u002Fphoto-1658329699942-ab19ead9b476?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=464&q=80","Any navigation device or map app will have toll booths marked and can give you the option to avoid these roads. A GPS or offline Google Maps is recommended, as the connection in Spain is not great. Try to load the route on your app before leaving a WiFi zone or driving with mobile data.","Tip",": Some of the toll roads take you past fantastic landscapes, which make up for the 5 – 10 EUR fee. For example, between Granada and Malaga you’ll cross a suspension bridge that overlooks the beautiful mountains in the area.","Large cities like Barcelona often experience traffic congestion, making it advisable to avoid driving during peak hours. Spain has four rush hours (horas puntas) due to the traditional afternoon break, but traffic can be heavy throughout the day. In certain cities like Madrid, vehicles are prohibited from entering the historic center to curb pollution.","A helpful tip when visiting larger cities in Spain is to park your car outside the central area and rely on public transportation instead. The urban public transport network, which includes metros, tramways, and buses, is quite reliable. Additionally, taking public transportation tends to be less expensive since parking rates tend to increase as you approach the city center.","Took this photo while walking through the beautiful El Retiro Park in Madrid.

It's essential to inspect the vehicle for any scratches or damages, which are not uncommon in Spain, and verify if they're noted on the form. If they're not, ensure that the rental agency employee acknowledges and documents them before you sign the check-out form. The form will also indicate the car's mileage and fuel level at the time of pickup.","To ensure that everything is properly documented, consider taking photos or videos of any damages noted on the rental car, the fuel level in the tank, and the car's previous mileage.

This is because many Spanish streets are narrow, parking spaces tend to be small, and gas prices are relatively high. If the rental agency suggests upgrading to a larger car, it's best to decline the offer.","One of the reasons why Spain's urban areas are so enchanting is that most of them have existed for centuries. Like its neighboring countries, Portugal and France, Spain's rich history is still evident, with many towns and villages having narrow cobblestoned roads. These roads can be challenging to navigate, so it's advisable to have an up-to-date navigation system and to follow the road signs carefully.","Camaleño, Cantabria, Spain","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.unsplash.com\u002Fphoto-1463003416389-296a1ad37ca0?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80","Finding a parking spot in the urban areas of Spain can be difficult, particularly in the historic centers, and the regulations can differ from one part of the city to another. On-street paid parking is identifiable by blue lines on the pavement, and you'll need to purchase a ticket from a nearby machine. Resident parking spots are designated by green markings or a black sign with the letter 'P' on it. Street parking is usually free on national holidays, Sundays, and after 7 PM in most urban areas, but it's essential to verify this to avoid any penalties.","pain, Catalonia. Montserrat.

It is not unusual to see drivers nudging other cars out of the way to find a suitable parking space. It is important to be cautious when parking and avoid leaving any valuables or personal belongings in plain sight inside the car, as theft from rental cars can occur.","When parking on the streets in certain areas of Spain, especially in the southern region, you may come across unofficial helpers who offer to assist with parking your car. It is important to note that they are not official employees and may request 1-2 EUR for their services. It is advisable to pay them to avoid any potential damage to your vehicle.","You can easily locate gas stations throughout Spain with the help of Google Maps or other navigation services. The average cost of fuel in Spain is around 1.90 EUR per liter (7.20 EUR per gallon), and you can choose between diesel (diesel) or unleaded (gasolina).

If you are unsure about which type of fuel your rental car requires, look for a sticker in the car that provides this information. The sticker can typically be found on the fuel door, dashboard, or car key. Gas stations are available in rural areas, small towns, big cities, and along the highways.","In Spain, gas stations may occasionally be unstaffed, particularly on Sundays, holidays, during lunchtime siestas, or late at night. If you find yourself driving during these periods, the only available gas stations may be automated and may only accept card payments.","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.unsplash.com\u002Fphoto-1660914721374-900e3a33674f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80","Renting a car in Spain is usually affordable. The cost is determined by factors such as the season you visit, the length of your trip, and the type of car you choose. Rental prices tend to be higher during the summer months due to increased demand. On the other hand, prices are lower during other seasons, including winter. The total cost is also influenced by the length of your rental period. Renting a car for a longer duration can lower the daily price, which means that 5 days of rental may cost only slightly more than 3 days.

You'll be glad to know that some car rental companies offer one-way international travel options.
